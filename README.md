# python-data-processing

To run the python script - 
1. Clone the repository.
2. Place the two input files into the cloned repository on your local machine. 
3. Ensure that you have python 2.7 installed (I'm on python 2.7.13 - https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/). 
4. Run "python count_by_zip.py" on the command line, while inside the cloned repository.

Note that the output.csv included in the repository will be overwritten when you run the script. The expected output is also available in output_backup.csv, if needed.
