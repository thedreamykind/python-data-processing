Data validation notes

- I ran the following commands on a bash terminal to validate the input and output data files. The commands were run from the directory containing the files.  
- Some of the commands require jq. If you would like to replicate these commands, please ensure that you have jq installed.

# Number of readings which qualify as a fever. 
Tue Sep 11 18:08 ~/git/pyhack : cat readings.jsonl | jq 'select(.temperature > 99.5)' | jq .user.id | wc -l

# Validate that the readings only contain data for one date. 
Tue Sep 11 18:08 ~/git/pyhack : cat readings.jsonl | jq .date | sort | uniq
"20180315"

# Number of users.
